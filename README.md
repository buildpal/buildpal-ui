# buildpal-ui
This project hosts the web front end for [buildpal](https://github.com/buildpal/buildpal-platform) server.

## Development
* The front-end is built using [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Oracle JET](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html)
* Download and install node.js
* Use npm to install Oracle JET command line tooling "npm -g install @oracle/ojet-cli"
* Use git to clone the source code from https://github.com/buildpal/buildpal-ui.git
* Build the code by running "ojet build"
* You can start exploring the app by running "ojet serve". The command will open a browser tab and point it to http://localhost:8000
* Open your favorite JavaScript IDE to make changes. When you change a file and save, the changes will be picked up by the running app (if you have "ojet serve" running in a terminal)
